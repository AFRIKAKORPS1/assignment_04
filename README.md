# Assignment 04 - Iterables and Conditions

As usual, please fork this assignment to your own repository and
clone the code locally to your computer.  This week you have eight
different algorithms to fill one focusing on point pattern analysis
and working with GeoJSON.  The former will focus on iteration and
sequences, while the latter looks at dictionaries and file I/O.

If you have any questions, please post in the forums.

Once you are happy with your assignment, go ahead and submit a pull request.
If TravisCI shows an error (red X in the pull request) feel free to update
your repository (`git add -A .`, `git commit`, `git push origin master`).  Please
*do not* open more than one pull request.
